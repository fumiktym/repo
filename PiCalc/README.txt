PIAnalysis3 provides a whole host of tools that can be used for pleasure and analysis.

This is always done with an open mind and intended for those who may know some programming
and some math, so rest assured knowing that this is not done with advanced math techiques. 
This is not done with advanced programming methods; in fact, it is mostly ad hoc directly from

as an example of "nice" code. 

Dissect the code as you wish because it is meant to be dissected and modified to your liking.
